# **Image Signal Processing and HDR Imaging**

This repository contains implementations of key image signal processing routines and HDR imaging algorithms. The tasks include:

## **1. Basic Image Signal Processing Routines**  
Processing raw sensor images using techniques like:  
- **Demosaic**  
- **White Balance**  
- **Gamma Correction**  
- **Denoising**  
- **Sharpening**  

## **2. Denoising and Sharpening Techniques**  
Implementation of multiple denoise and sharpness techniques, along with an assessment of their impact on image quality:
- **Gaussian filter**  
- **Median filter**  
- **Bilateral filter**
- **Denoise AI-model** 
- **Spacial SNR**  
- **Laplacian filter**
- **EdgeÂ strength**

## **3. HDR Imaging**  
Development and implementation of a **High Dynamic Range (HDR)** image processing using the OpenCV library in Python. The project merges multiple exposure images into HDR images using three popular methods:
- **Debevec**
- **Robertson** 
- **Fusion Mertens**
  
Additionally, the tone-mapped outputs are displayed for visualization and saved as images.
